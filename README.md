# WindowsConsole-OBJRenderer

Render 3D OBJ model files directly in the Windows Console with color output, using CUDA for parallel processing to improve rendering performance.

## What We Made

### Console Monitor Class
- Handles output of rendered images in the Windows console.
- Since the Windows console supports only a limited set of colors, this class introduces a **3x3 RGB pixel system** to represent a wider variety of colors.

### Model Class
- Loads OBJ-format files and stores data about faces, vertices, and textures.
- Quadrilateral faces are divided into triangles without generating new vertices.
- Faces with more than 4 vertices are not supported (assumed not to be present).
- Assumes the use of a single texture.

### Scene Class
- Stores objects to render, lights, the main directional light, and the sky color.

### GameObject Class
- Stores each renderable object‚Äôs model data along with its **position, rotation, and scale**.

### Vertex Shader
- Transforms each vertex into **clip space coordinates** using MVP transformation.  
- Parallelized on the GPU using CUDA.

### Rasterizer
- Performs perspective division, back-face culling, viewport transformation, scan conversion, and clipping.
- Clipping does not generate new vertices‚Äîfaces outside the viewport simply do not produce fragments.
- During scan conversion, fills the depth buffer and applies **Z-test**.
- Parallelized on the GPU using CUDA.

### Fragment Shader
- Determines the final pixel color.
- Currently, only diffuse texture colors are used (lighting not implemented).
- Parallelized on the GPU using CUDA.

## Limitations
- Vertex and fragment shaders are not programmable‚Äîonly predefined operations are supported.
- Lighting calculations are not yet implemented, so only diffuse textures are displayed.
